        <p>Thank you for filling in the who am I form! Your motivation is clear to me and I understand it's hard to know what you would like as a career since you have another four years to think about that. You state you have an interest in data science and in business consultancy. I am curious, what specific is your point of interest here?

            Being shy is a very good trade as far as I'm concerned and indeed gives you very well-developed listening skills. Usually, shyness has to do with feeling safe and knowing people we will put a great effort into you getting to know your classmates and feel comfortable with us teachers. What makes you place it as a weakness? what will happen because of your shyness which might limit you or offer a risk?
            
            Looking forward to seeing you at the start of the program. Do not hesistate to ask any questions if you have them!</p>
