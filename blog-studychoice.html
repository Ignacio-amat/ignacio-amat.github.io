      <h1>Study Choice</h1>
      <h3>Motivating my Choice</h3>
      <p> I am interested in learning different coding languages and applications in real life situations. For me it is very important that this program is practice oriented, as that is how I learn best.</p>

      <h3>After my study</h3>
      <p>I am still not 100% sure what I want to do when I graduate, but from your website I was able to learn about two different occupations that interested me: Data Scientist and Business IT consultant. Of course I still have 4 years to make my final choice, however, using data to find relevant information for businesses to make informed decisions is making me lean towards that part of the program. </p>

      <p>For the last couple of years I have been going to a coding course that taught me how to code with python and little bit of html.</p>
